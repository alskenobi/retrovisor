I alwas had problem to check my hardware while playing games, programming and etc... that is why I decided to make this Computer Monitor using Arduino; I called it Retrovisor (Rearview mirror in portuguese).

Using this you can check your CPU / memory usage, process running, stand by process, battery life and network usage without opening any screen on your computer.
